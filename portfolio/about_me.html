            <section class="about_me_statement">For you to get to know more about me, My name Is Noah Carrier and I am currently a Computer Science Major studying at Brigham Younge University in Idaho. From my studies, I have a good foundation in making webpages using HTML and CSS that are functional and look incredible. I also have the basic foundations of the programming languages of JavaScript and Python but I'm continually broadening my understanding of those and other programming languages. I am someone that is looking for more opportunities to branch out and build up a network of people. Feel free to look at some of my works to see if I am a fit for you or your business. For those who want to know a little bit more about the personal part of my life. I love to create and I find myself drawn to many different forms of creativity from something as simple as art to building different projects that make life a little bit easier. I also love to find ways to problem-solve and figure out all sorts of puzzles. For those who know me know that I am an extrovert that likes getting to know people and broadening my field of friends and influence. If you want to know more about my educational knowledge or about my personal life please contact me and ask questions. My contact information is all located on my contact page. And again, feel free to look around and see some of the works that were created.</section>
